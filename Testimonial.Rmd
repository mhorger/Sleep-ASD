# Bramli

###Diagnosed with sleep apnea 
“Bramli had 15 hypopnea and apnea episodes and 63 micro-arousals in just one night.” 

###She had surgery to remove her tonsils 

“The girl has been sleeping more deeply and is able to make it through the days with less crying. She is less manic, with more stable levels of energy, her mother says.” 

###But she continued to have problems with falling asleep

“Finding the right combination of solutions can be a journey, as Haley Bennett and her husband have learned. The family always had well-structured bedtime routines, and melatonin therapy didn’t make much difference for Bramli.”
