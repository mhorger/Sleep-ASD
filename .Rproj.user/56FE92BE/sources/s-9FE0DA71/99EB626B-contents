## Disrupted Sleep	
Most common problems: 
“…prolonged sleep latency, decreased sleep efficiency, reduced total sleep time, increased waking after sleep-onset, bedtime resistance, and daytime sleepiness” (Cohen et al., 2014, p. 2)

It is possible to have multiple co-occurring sleep problems  

It is very common for sleep problems to persist with age.
