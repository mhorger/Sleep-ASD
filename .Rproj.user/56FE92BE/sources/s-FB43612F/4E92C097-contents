abstract: |
  Naps are beneficial for learning in typically developing infants, children, and adults. They show greater retention when a delay between training and test contains sleep then when it is a comparable period of wake. However, individuals with Down syndrome have a high rate of disordered sleep than seen in the typical population. Do they experience the same benefits of sleep on learning?

# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results

```{r myfig, fig.cap="Hist-o-JAMS"}

```


```{r}
#{r, fig.height=, fig.width=, out.height=, out.width=}
#it's going to be one of these things that determines how you change the size of your document
#it depends on the kind of output youre trying to get. html is going to be pixels, pdf has to go through latex 
#just use the working examples because the underlying logic is complicated AF 
#tried this for midterm and use fig.width and just put in a number and it assumes that is inches
```
