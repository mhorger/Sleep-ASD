## How frequently do sleep problems occur on the spectrum? 

**Anywhere from 40-80% of individuals with autism have sleep problems (Cohen et al., 2014)**

## Why are sleep problems more common for autistics? 

Some researchers believe sleep problems are an additional symptom of ASD. For example, they may stem from neurophysiological differences,  hyperactivity, or hyposensitivity. 

Others hypothesize that disrupted sleep is a byproduct of comorbidity such as gastrointestinal disorders or seizures. They may also be impacted by medications. 
(Cohen et al., 2018)

The severity of sleep problems are related to severity of ASD symptoms. However, the direction of this relationship is unclear- more severe symptoms may trigger disordered sleep or vice versa. 


## What are the effects of disrupted sleep? 

Poor sleep negatively effects physical health, emotion regulation, cognition, and behavior. 

It can exacerbate symptoms of ASD including 
restricted and repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, and externalizing behaviors
