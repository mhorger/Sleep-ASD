## Disrupted Sleep	
Most common problems: 

1. trouble falling asleep 

2. waking up during the night

3. reduced time spent sleeping

4. bedtime resistance

5. daytime sleepiness 



It is possible to have multiple co-occurring sleep problems  

It is very common for sleep problems to persist with age. 

Parents sometimes feel as though disrupted sleep is inevitable and do not recognize that it is treatable. 


#Sleep Disorders	

### 1. Sleep-disordered breathing
Peaks from 2 to 6 years of age, but
also occurs in younger children.

####Apnea 
Apneas occur when an individual seems to stop breathing or hold ther breath for several seconds at a time while asleep

####Snoring 
While snoring is relatively common, it can be problematic if individuals snore for more
than a few minutes at a time

####Mouth breathing is also a common problem 



### 2. Movement disorders
Individuals report an urge to move (usually focused on the legs but not always) when at rest. 

People describe it differently including "uncomfortable, unpleasant, creepy-crawly, jittery, internal itch, or shock-like feelings". 

These feelings are usually felt over large areas of the thighs or calves (or both) and are usually experienced as coming from deep within the leg rathing than on the skin. 

**Specfic movement disorders include:**

 Restless leg syndrome 
 
Periodic leg movement 

### 3. Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and unwanted episodes of sleep. These episodes may last anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours. 


### 4. Insomnia
Insomnia is an inability to fall asleep. 

### 5. Parasomnias
Parasomnias are a large group of disorders that produce nocturnal events. Nocturnal events can include dreaming, sleep talking, or sleep walking. 
These events may be common behaviors, but they also may include bizarre and unusual events like seemingly purposeful movements.

**Specific examples of parasomnias include:**

Night terrors 

Sleep walking 

Nightmares 

### 6. Circadian Rhythm Disorder
These occur when there is a disruption or misalignment between the timing of an individual's circadian clock (their body's clock) and the 24-hour social and physical environment. 

####Advanced and delayed sleep latency  
Two examples are falling asleep too early in the night- like wanting to go to bed at 4pm- or falling asleep too late- such as not feeling sleepy until 2am.
