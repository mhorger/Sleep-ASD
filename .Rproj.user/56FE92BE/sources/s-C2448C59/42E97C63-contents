abstract: |
  Naps are beneficial for learning in typically developing infants, children, and adults. They show greater retention when a delay between training and test contains sleep then when it is a comparable period of wake. However, individuals with Down syndrome have a high rate of disordered sleep than seen in the typical population. Do they experience the same benefits of sleep on learning?

## Materials & Procedure 

![Methods](C:\Users\mhorger\Documents\GitHub\Reproducible-Report_Horger\methods.PNG)



The goal of this study was to assess the retention of new words with various intervals between training and test. Children received all conditions 1-2 weeks apart. The conditions included:
1. after a 5 min delay
2. after a nap (4 hour delay)
3. after 24 hours

## Data analysis
The authors assessed the number of trials needed to reach criterion across conditions and groups. 

The first analysis conducted was a repeated measures ANOVA for both wake and nap conditions. The second was a 2x2 ANOVA with delay type as the repeated factor and TD or DS as the between. These were conducted for the 4 and 24 hour delay.

The second was a 2x2 ANOVA with delay type as the repeated factor and TD or DS as the between. These were conducted for the 4 and 24 hour delay. 


We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.
