## How does someone find out if they have disordered sleep?

#### Polysomnographies can be difficult, especially for autistics. They typically require a person to sleep in a lab while connected to a lot of sensors, mostly on their head. 


####  Recently, researchers have developed a way to do polysomnographies at home. They developed a protocol specfically for people on the spectrum.

## What treatments are there for sleep problems? 

With a comprehensive sleep evaluation in hand, a clinician can tailor the best combination of behavioral therapies, medications or other treatments to each individual with autism. For instance, in cases in which bad sleep habits are involved, children can benefit when parents establish better routines — from minimizing caffeine intake to restricting video games before bed.
